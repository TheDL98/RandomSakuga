# RandomSakuga
A Python script that uses the moebooru API to communicate with [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com) to fetch a random animated video. The Video is then posted to Facebook using the Graph API along with some info like the artist name, the media title (movie/TV show/OVA/etc) and a possible link to MyAnimeList queried using the Jikan API if the media is eastern.

## INSTALL
    pipx install git+https://github.com/TheDL98/RandomSakuga

## TODO
- [ ] Add current step status
- [ ] Add standard input options that override the config file
